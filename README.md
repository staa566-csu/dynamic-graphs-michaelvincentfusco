I found the data from https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/stock-price-history. It's stock data for Tesla from the last 10 years. It's well known that Elon Musk uses Twitter to manipulate Tesla's stock price. I wanted to compare his Twitter activity to the stock price to see if there was an obvious influence. The results weren't as obvious as I was hoping for. Maybe if I was more knowlegable about stocks I could better tell.

I used dygraphs to create the time-series chart. I added some vertical lines to mark dates that had significant Twitter activity. I added a range finder to be able to zoom in on those dates and look at what happened to the stock. I wanted to use dots that I could hover over and have a screen appear showing the tweet instead of throwing down some lines, but I couldn't figure out how to in time. From what I think I understand, that would take CSS knowledge, of which I have none.
